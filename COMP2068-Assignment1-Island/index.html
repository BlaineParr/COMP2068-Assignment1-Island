                    You were on a cruise ship when it hit a rock and sank. You awake on an uninhabited
                    island. You can either head into the jungle or swim to one of two fairly close islands you
                    see in the distance.

                    You head into the jungle, but you are quite thirsty. You see a tree with coconuts in it,
                    but you also see what looks like it could be a body of fresh water closer to the centre
                    of the island.

                    You head to the water you spotted. As you approach, you notice a strange altar
                    infront of the lake. You also notice something shining off to your left.

                        leg. Before you have a chance to act you are draggen under water. The last thing you
                        see is a large open mouth. You died.

                    You swim towards the islands. Halfway through your swim, you must decide if you want to
                    head to the left island, or the right island.

                    As you swim towards the left island, you find a strange wooden idol floating in the ocean. It looks like a squid.
                    You feel like the idol is somehow related to the island you just left. You take the idol. Should you continue
                    swimming to the left island, instead go to the right island or go back to where you came from?
