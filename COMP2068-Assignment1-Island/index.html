                    You were on a cruise ship when it hit a rock and sank. You awake on an uninhabited
                    island. You can either head into the jungle or swim to one of two fairly close islands you

                    You head into the jungle, but you are quite thirsty. You see a tree with coconuts in it,
                    but you also see what looks like it could be a body of fresh water closer to the centre
                    of the island.

                        your leg. Before you have a chance to act you are dragged under water. The last
                        thing you see is a large open mouth. You died.

                        Kraken whips out a tentacle tripping you. The Kraken then wraps one of its
                        tentacles around you and throws you into its mouth. You died.

                        movement the Kraken raises one of its tentacles and slams it down on you. You
                        died.

                    you just left. You take the idol. Should you continue swimming to the left island,

                    around you starts to swirl. The swirling becomes faster and faster. A whirlpool has
                    formed around you! You are sucked underwater and as you submerge the idol escapes
                    your hand. The violent thrashing of the water whips you around -- conciousness fades.
